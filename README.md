# Toolbox to compute modulation filterbank features

The script covers the following functionalities:
1) compute spectrogram energies (original and log) using customized filterbanks
2) compute modulation spectrogram energies (original and log) using customized filterbanks
3) customize filterbanks (number of filter, linear/mel, etc.)

It also provides short demos for each step of the computation, from the original spectrogram to filtered spectrogram, and filtered modulation spectrogram.
